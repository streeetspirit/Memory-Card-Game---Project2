# Memory Card Game Project2 Udacity FEND 
Assignment #2 from Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree. 

For this project I used existing template provided by Udacity. This is a java script based game, so majority of the coding happened in .js file. Of course .html and .css files were edited too.

# Game rules
Flip two card and ty to match them. If cards don't match they will unflip. Player wins when all the cards are flipped. Try to do it in the shortest amount of time.
