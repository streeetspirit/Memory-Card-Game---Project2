# Memory Card Game Project2 Udacity FEND
Assignment #2 from Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree.

For this project I used existing template provided by Udacity. This is a java script based game, so majority of the coding happened in .js file. Of course, .html and .css files were edited too.

# Game rules
Flip two card and try to match them. If cards don't match they will flip back. Player wins when all the cards are flipped. Try to do it in the shortest amount of time.

# UI elements
* Player starts with 3 stars but after he reaches 22 moves amount of starts decreases.
* Timer starts automatically when player flips the first card
* Moves increment with every card flip
* Reset button lets reset current progress of the game and timer

After finishing a game player will be congratulated and given an opportunity to write his name.
There's a scoreboard, entries are added as they come. It is not stored anywhere else but the current page. It resets with a page refresh.

# Third party libraries and dependencies used in this project
* jquery
* font awesome (for icons on cards and UI)
* Google fonts

Thank you for playing a game!
